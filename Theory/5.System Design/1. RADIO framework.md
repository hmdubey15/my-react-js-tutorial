System design in the front end involves planning and structuring the architecture of a web application to ensure scalability, maintainability, performance, and a good user experience. <span style="color: Violet;">RADIO framework</span> (Requirements, Architecture, Data Model, Interface Definitions(API), Optimizations) should be used to describe the frontend system design.

1. **Requirements exploration:** Understand the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking a number of clarifying questions.
2. **Architecture / High-level design:** Identify the key components of the product and how they are related to each other.
3. **Data model:** Describe the various data entities, the fields they contain and which component(s) they belong to.
4. **Interface definition (API):** Define the interface (API) between components in the product, functionality of each API, their parameters and responses.
5. **Optimizations and deep dive:** Discuss about possible optimization opportunities and specific areas of interest when building the product.

# 1. Requirements Gathering

Requirement gathering is the process of identifying and defining a project's needs from start to finish. The goal of requirement gathering is to understand what's being built and why, and to define the features that will translate ideas into a tangible product. Requirement gathering usually takes place during the project initiation phase, but it's important to continue managing requirements throughout the entire project timeline. Requirements are broadly categorized into <span style="color: Cyan;">functional</span> and <span style="color: Yellow;">non-functional</span> requirements.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Functional Requirements</h3>

Basic requirements of the product such that the product cannot function without them. This is usually whether a user can complete the core flows correctly. Let's take a look at functional requirements of an e-commerce site:

- **User Management:** Login and authentication
- **Help & Support:** A support chatbot to connect customers to agents if they need some help.
- **Payment Gateway:** Support all the possible payment methods
- **Pricing & Subscription**
- **Product Search Support**
- **Language Change**
- **Order History**
- **Cart and Wishlist**
- **Ads management**
- **Product Listing**
- **Product Reviews**

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Non-Functional Requirements</h3>

Requirements that are viewed as improvements to the product, but not strictly required for the product to be usable, i.e. the product can still be used without these. These include performance (how fast the page loads, how fast the interaction takes), scalability (how many items can be present on the page), good user experience, etc. Some general non-functional requirements:

- **Accessibility**
- **Analytics**
- **CI/CD Build pipelines**
- **Cross-Browser & Cross-Device compatibility + Responsiveness**
- **Error Handling**
- **Internationalisation and Localisation**
- **Offline Support**
- **Performance**
- **Scalability**
- **Security**
- **SEO**
- **Testing**

<div style="border: 1px solid yellow; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(103, 217, 230, 0.43);">
After deciding the requirements, one must set the scope of those requirements in given time. Means which requirements must be prioritised and all those things.
</div>

# 2. Architecture / High-level design

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Tech Stack</h3>

- **Architecture:** Monolithic or Micro-frontend / Packages or Monorepo(using `Nx`, `Lerna`) / SPA vs MPA / CSR vs SSR
- **Styling Tools:**
  - **CSS Frameworks:** `Bootstrap`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Material-UI`.
  - **Preprocessors:** `SASS`, `LESS` for more powerful styling.
- **Library / Framework and Language:** React, Angular, Vue, etc. + TypeScript
- **State Management:**
  - **Local State:** Managed within individual components using hooks or local state.
  - **Global State:** Libraries like `Redux`, `MobX`, or `Context` API in React.
  - **Server State:** Data fetched from APIs and cached or managed using libraries like `TanStack Query(React Query)` or `SWR`.
- **Build Tools:** Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc.
- **Routing tools:** React router dom
- **Data fetching tools:** Axios, Tanstack Query
- **Testing Tools:**
  - **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions. Jest, Mocha + Chai, etc.
  - **Integration Testing:** Testing combinations of components or modules. Libraries like `React Testing Library`.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Test entire app's workflow - Cypress, Selenium, etc.
- **Deployment tools:** CI/CD, Docker, Jenkins

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Component Design</h3>

Next task is to come up with a product/system architecture by identifying the key components of the product, how the components interact with each other, and how they are related.

Diagrams are your friends here. Each component can be represented using a rectangle and your high-level design usually ends up looking like a few rectangular boxes with arrows between them to demonstrate the flow of data. It is also possible to have components within components, in that case, draw the parent using bigger rectangles since they need to fit multiple subcomponents.

Common folder structure of a monorepo setup:

- `project-base`: Base routes, internationalisation, custom scripts, configuration of other MFs, local and production server setups, readers, helper functions, etc.
- `project-components`: Reusable components, custom hooks, hocs, standard styles
  - `atoms`
  - `molecules`
  - `organisms`
  - `hocs`
  - `hooks`
  - `styles`
- `project-internal`: Internal configuration pages: Portal for employees management like roles and permissions, login/signup, approval tools, user setup, env and deployment management. It will also have configuration of customer facing app.
- `project-root-shell`: Main container of all microfrontends. It will have common skeleton - headers, footers, etc.
- **<u>[ADD MONOREPOS AS PER PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT]</u>**

<b style="color:red;">NOTE:</b> Must use the diagrams to show the hierarchy of components.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Routing</h3>

Define all routes and components to render on them.

# 3. Data Model

Describe the various data entities, the fields they contain and which component(s) they belong to. We now have to think about what data fields are present in the client. There are two kinds of data on client applications:

- **Server-originated data:** Data that originates from the server, usually from a database and meant to be seen by multiple people or accessed from multiple different devices. Common examples include user data (name, profile picture) and user-generated data (feed posts, comments).
- **Client-only data:** Client-only data, also commonly known as state, is data that only needs to live on the client and does not have to be sent to the server for writing into the database. Client data can be further broken down into two:
  - **Data to be persisted:** Usually user input such as data entered into form fields. These data usually has to be sent to the server and saved into a database for it to be useful.
  - **Ephemeral data:** Temporary state that lasts for a short time. Common examples include form validation state, the current tab, whether a section is expanded, etc. It's usually acceptable to lose these data when the browser tab is closed.

<br>

# 4. Interface Definition (API) / Communication protocols

Define the interface between components in the product, functionality of the various APIs, their parameters and responses.

With the components and data within each components, we can move on to discuss the interface (APIs) between the components. API is an overloaded term and generally refer to the protocol which software components communicate and request/send data between components. Client and server communicate via network layer APIs (HTTP/WebSockets). Client components generally communicate via functions in the browser runtime. 

- <b style="color:Salmon;">RESTful APIs</b>: Standard way of communication between front-end and back-end. Using libraries like `Axios` or `Fetch` API.
- <b style="color:Salmon;">GraphQL</b>: More flexible query language for APIs. With GraphQL, the frontend can request exactly the data it needs, no more and no less. Libraries like `Apollo Client` or `Relay`.
- <b style="color:Salmon;">WebSockets</b>: WebSockets are different from traditional HTTP requests, which are one-way and require a new connection for each request. With WebSockets, communication can be continuous, and the server can send messages to connected clients. This allows for interactive communication sessions, such as sending messages to a server and receiving event-driven responses. Libraries like `Socket.io`.

<div style="border: 1px solid yellow; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(103, 114, 230, 0.2);">
For real-time communication, decide which one among the following needs to be used:

- Short Polling
- Long Polling
- Server Side Events (SSEs)
- Web Sockets

# 5. Optimizations and deep dive

- Minimize the number of re-renders:
  - Use appropriate keys while rendering lists.
  - Use `React.memo`, `React.useCallback`, `React.useMemo`
- Memoize the heavy computations using `useMemo` and `defaultMemoize` (from `recompose` library: Used to memoize on the basis of arguments passed to function)
- Make sure that for a particular functionality, all network calls are in parallel if they are not dependent on responses of each other. Also there should be limit the number of concurrent API calls. This reduces network congestion and server overload.
- Use **debounce** (example: search input, user to select all filters before applying, resize events, save draft form functionality) and **throttle**(example: handling scroll events, limiting frequency of button clicks, mouse move events) to limit the number of netword calls.
- Avoid redundant API calls by caching responses. Methods to do this:
  - Use headers wisely to take max advantage of HTTP caching: Incorporate content hashes into filenames so that browsers can cache files long-term but still update when necessary and configure your build and server headers to leverage browser caching.
  - Browser Cache (LocalStorage, SessionStorage)
  - In-memory Cache (React Query, Redux Toolkit Query)
  - Service Workers (for offline caching)
- Use pagination: Fetch only a subset of data instead of loading everything at once.
- Prefetch the data before the user requests it to improve perceived speed.
- Make sure that loading of scripts are deferred.
- Lazy loading / Code splitting: Route based, component level splitting (tabs, components not on screen), library splitting.
- Webpack bundle splitting: Use Webpack’s `splitChunks` to separate vendor code from your app’s code. This helps with caching and reduces bundle sizes.
- Make sure no heavy npm packages are istalled until there's no choice. Try to search for lighter alternatives.
- Apply webpack optimizations like removing dead code using tree shaking, css minification, gzip/brotli compression.
- Asset Optimization: 
    - Compression: Use tools to compress images without sacrificing quality.
    - Modern Formats: Consider using WebP or AVIF.
    - Responsive Images: Serve appropriately sized images using `srcset` and `sizes`. `<picture>` element can be used too.
    - Use native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`, `fetchpriority` and `content-visibility`) or libraries like `react-lazyload`.
    - Load assets when they’re about to enter the viewport (e.g., using `IntersectionObserver`).
- Optimize Redux with reselect for memoized selectors.
- Offload heavy computations to web workers.
- Use resource hints like `preload`, `prefetch`, `preconnect`, etc. for loading critical assets early.
- Virtualisation: Use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to render only visible items.
- Optimizing CRP:
    - Identify and reduce the render blocking resources.
    - Minimisse DOM manipulations. Batch DOM updates using document fragment and CSS manipulations.
    - Avoid unnecessary complex CSS selectors.
    - Cache layout properties like `offsetHeight`, `offsetWidth`, etc.
    - Use flexbox and grid containers.
- Avoid manipulating DOM Directly in React.
