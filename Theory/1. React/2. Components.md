<b>React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup(similar to HTML). Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.</b>

On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like `<h1>` and `<li>`. React lets us combine our markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù (reusable UI elements for your app). Example: The table of contents code below could be turned into a `<TableOfContents />` component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like `<article>`, `<h1>`, etc. Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages.

```html
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

<u>**Defining a component:**</u>

Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: <span style="color: Cyan;">a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup.</span> Here‚Äôs what that looks like

```js
export default function Welcome() {
  return <div>Welcome to the world of React!</div>;
}
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">And here‚Äôs how to build a component:</h3>

1. <b>Export the component</b>: The `export default` prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax. It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files.

2. <b>Define the function</b>: With `function Welcome() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name `Welcome`. <span style="color: Chartreuse;">Name of components must start with a capital letter or they won‚Äôt work!</span> This is because what browser sees is that when tag starts with small letter, React knows we are referring to HTML tag while when it starts with capital letter, React knows that we want to use our component called `Welcome`.

3. <b>Add markup</b>: The component returns a `div` tag. This tag is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called <span style="color: Coral;">JSX</span>, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript. <span style="color: Orange;">If markup isn‚Äôt all on the same line as the `return` keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses</span> otherwise any code on the lines after return will be ignored!

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Nesting and organizing components</h3>

Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file.

```js
export default function Gallery() {
  // ...
}
// ‚úÖ Declare components at the top level
function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery‚Äîeven several times!‚Äîwe can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.

<b style="color: Red;">NOTE:</b> Components can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions. This makes code very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level like above, not like this:

```js
export default function Gallery() {
  // üî¥ Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

When a child component needs some data from a parent, pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.

# JSX (JavaScript XML)

<b>JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.</b> Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and <span style="color: Violet;">can display dynamic information</span>. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Rules of JSX</h3>

1. <b style="color:Salmon;">Return a single root element</b>: To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag. For example, you can use a `<div>`. If you don‚Äôt want to add an extra `<div>` to your markup, you can write `<>` and `</>` instead. This empty tag is called a `Fragment`. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree. JSX tags need to be wrapped because JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can‚Äôt return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also can‚Äôt return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.

2. <b style="color:Salmon;">Close all the tags</b>: JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become `<img />`.

3. <b style="color:Salmon;">camelCase most of the thing</b>: JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can‚Äôt contain dashes or be reserved words like class. This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of `stroke-width` you use `strokeWidth`. Since `class` is a reserved word, in React you write `className` instead

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces</h3>

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.

When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes. But what if you want to dynamically specify the `src` or `alt` text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing `"` and `"` with `{` and `}`.

```js
export default function Avatar() {
  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return <img className="avatar" src={avatar} alt={description} />;
}
```

JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it‚Äôs possible to use JavaScript inside it‚Äîwith curly braces `{}`. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, name, then embeds it with curly braces inside the `<h1>`:

```js
export default function TodoList() {
  const name = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>;
}
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Where to use curly braces?</h3>

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. <b>As text directly inside a JSX tag.</b>

2. <b>As attributes immediately following the `=` sign</b>.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Adding CSS in JSX</h3>

Generally two ways are used for adding CSS in React:

<b>(1) INLINE STYLING</b>

When we need an inline style, we pass an object to the `style` attribute like this:

```js
export default function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: 'black',
        color: 'pink',
      }}
    >
      There's no such thing as bad ideas. It's just poorly executed and awesome ones.
    </div>
  );
}
```

<b>NOTE: </b>As shown above, Inline style properties are written in camelCase.

<b>(2) CSS STYLESHEET</b>

You can write your CSS styling in a separate file, just save the file with the .css file extension, and import it in your application like the below code:

```js
import React from 'react';
import './Component.css';

const Component = () => {
  return <div className="component-container">Content goes here</div>;
};

export default Component;
```

```css
/* Component.css */
.component-container {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

<b style="color: Red;">NOTE:</b> We can use the `id` attribute for adding CSS styles to elements in React, just like we would in regular HTML. However, it is generally not recommended to use it, especially when we have multiple instances of the same component on the page because IDs are unique in the HTML document and if we reuse the same component multiple times on the page, applying styles via IDs could lead to global styles and cause conflicts. Instead of using IDs, it is a common best practice in React to use class names for styling elements. This approach promotes better encapsulation, reusability, and maintainability of components.

# Keeping Components Pure

A pure function is a function that:

1. Always produces the same output for the same input arguments, regardless of how many times it's called
2. Has no side effects - meaning it doesn't modify anything outside its scope (like global variables or the DOM)

```js
// Pure function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Pure function
function formatName(firstName, lastName) {
    return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}

// Not pure - relies on external state
let counter = 0;
function incrementCounter() {
    counter++;
    return counter;
}

// Not pure - modifies the DOM (side effect)
function updateHeader(text) {
    document.querySelector('h1').textContent = text;
}
```

By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. React is designed around this concept. React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs.

```jsx
let guest = 0;

function Cup() {
  // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!
  guest = guest + 1;
  return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}

export default function TeaSet() {
  return (
    <>
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
      <Cup />
    </>
  );
}
```

OUTPUT:
```
Tea cup for guest #2
Tea cup for guest #4
Tea cup for guest #6
```

This component is reading and writing a guest variable declared outside of it. This means that calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX! And what‚Äôs more, if other components read guest, they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That‚Äôs not predictable.
