**Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating global application state, where the UI triggers events called "actions" to describe what happened, and separate update logic called "reducers" updates the state in response.** It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

<br>

# Core concepts of redux

<b style="color:Salmon;">1. Store:</b> The single source of truth where the entire state of the application is stored. The state in the store is <span style="color: Cyan;">immutable</span> and can only be changed by dispatching actions.<br>
<b style="color:Salmon;">2. Action:</b> An object that describes what happened in the application. Every action must have a <span style="color: Lime;">type</span> property, which describes the action being performed, and optionally other data as payload. Example:

```js
const action = { type: 'ACTION_NAME', payload: 1 };
```

<b style="color:Salmon;">3. Action Creator:</b> A function that creates and returns an action object.

```js
const actionCreator = (value) => {
  return {
    type: 'ACTION_NAME',
    payload: value,
  };
};
```

<b style="color:Salmon;">4. Reducer:</b> A function that takes the current state and an action as inputs and returns the new state - `(state, action) => newState`. Reducers are responsible for determining how the state should change based on the action. You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type. Reducer function must follow following rules:

- It must be pure function - should only calculate the new state value based on the `state` and `action` arguments only.
- It must not modify the existing state, instead it should copy the previous state, modify it and then return it.
- It must not do any asynchronous logic like API calls, calculate random values, or cause other "side effects".
- It must not create random values like `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`.

<b style="color:Salmon;">5. Dispatch:</b> The Redux store has a method called <span style="color: Lime;">dispatch</span>. The only way to update the state is to call `store.dispatch()` and pass in an `action` object. The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside, and we can call `getState()` to retrieve the updated value.

<b style="color:Salmon;">6. Selectors:</b> Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from the state. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:

```js
const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.value;
```

<b style="color:Salmon;">6. Middleware:</b> Functions that sit between the dispatching of an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Middleware can be used for logging, performing asynchronous actions, or interacting with APIs.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/z4y7sj/redux_vs_context_what_exactly_does_redux/"><u>Redux vs Context</u></a>

Context and Redux are very different tools that solve different problems, with some overlap.

Context is not a "state management" tool. It's a Dependency Injection mechanism, whose only purpose is to make a single value accessible to a nested tree of React components. It's up to you to decide what that value is, and how it's created. Typically, that's done using data from React component state, ie, `useState` and `useReducer`. So, you're actually doing all the "state management" yourself - Context just gives you a way to pass it down the tree.

Redux is a library and a pattern for separating your state update logic from the rest of your app, and making it easy to trace when/where/why/how your state has changed. It also gives your whole app the ability to access any piece of state in any component.

In addition, there are some distinct differences between how Context and (React-)Redux pass along updates. Context has some major perf limitations - in particular, any component that consumes a context will be forced to re-render, even if it only cares about part of the context value.

Context is a great tool by itself, and I use it frequently in my own apps. But, Context doesn't "replace Redux". Sure, you can use both of them to pass data down, but they're not the same thing. It's like asking "Can I replace a hammer with a screwdriver?". No, they're different tools, and you use them to solve different problems.

# Data Flow in Redux App

- Initial setup:
  - A Redux store is created using a root reducer function.
  - The store calls the root reducer once, and saves the return value as its initial `state`.
  - When the UI is first rendered, UI components access the current state of the Redux store, and use that data to decide what to render. They also subscribe to any future store updates so they can know if the state has changed.
- Updates:
  - Something happens in the app, such as a user clicking a button.
  - The app code dispatches an action to the Redux store, like `dispatch({type: 'counter/incremented'})`.
  - The store runs the reducer function again with the previous `state` and the current `action`, and saves the return value as the new `state`.
  - The store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the store has been updated
  - Each UI component that needs data from the store checks to see if the parts of the state they need have changed.
  - Each component that sees its data has changed forces a re-render with the new data, so it can update what's shown on the screen.

# All steps of setting up redux core

<div style="border: 1px solid yellow; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(251, 176, 133, 0.2);">

❌ <b style="color:Orange;">BELOW METHODS ARE DEPRECATED! </b> ❌

Redux Toolkit is new way of working with redux! We need to learn this for company's legacy code and understanding core concepts!

</div>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">1. Install package</h3>

To install the redux core package by itself:

```bash
# NPM
npm install redux

# Yarn
yarn add redux
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">2. Creating Reducer</h3>

<span style="color: Violet;">A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function that you will pass to `createStore` later on.</span> That one root reducer function is responsible for handling all of the actions that are dispatched, and calculating what the entire new state result should be every time.

```js
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + action.payload;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

A reducer may be called with `undefined` as the state value when the application is being initialized. If that happens, we need to provide an initial state value so the rest of the reducer code has something to work with. <span style="color: HotPink;">Reducers normally use default argument syntax to provide initial state: `(state = initialState, action)`</span>.

Single reducer function can become excessively long. That's why **reducers are typically split into multiple smaller reducer functions** - to make it easier to understand and maintain the reducer logic. **Redux reducers are typically split apart based on the section of the Redux state that they update.**

```js
// counterReducer.js

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

```js
// userReducer.js

const userReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_USER':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    case 'REMOVE_USER':
      return state.filter((user) => user.id !== action.payload);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

The reducer for a specific section of the Redux app state is called a <span style="color: Cyan;">"slice reducer"</span> and redux code for a particular feature is usually written as a single file, known as a <span style="color: Cyan;">"slice"</span> file (which contains all the reducer logic and all of the action-related code for that part of your app state).

Redux store needs one root reducer function when we create it. Since reducers are normal JS functions, we can import the slice reducers back into `reducer.js`, and write a new root reducer whose only job is to call the other two functions.

```js
// reducer.js

export default function rootReducer(state = {}, action) {
  // always return a new object for the root state
  return {
    // the value of `state.counter` is whatever the counter reducer returns
    counter: counterReducer(state.counter, action),
    // For both reducers, we only pass in their slice of the state
    users: usersReducer(state.users, action),
  };
}
```

<b style="color:Coral;">Note that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.</b> We can see that the new root reducer is doing the same thing for each slice: calling the slice reducer, passing in the slice of the state owned by that reducer, and assigning the result back to the root state object. If we were to add more slices, the pattern would repeat. The Redux core library includes a utility called <b style="color:SpringGreen;">combineReducers</b>, which does this same boilerplate step for us. We can replace our hand-written `rootReducer` with a shorter one generated by `combineReducers`.

```js
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Define a top-level state field named `counter`, handled by `counterReducer`
  counter: counterReducer,
  users: usersReducer,
});
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">3. Creating Store</h3>

You'll only have a single store in a Redux application. When you want to split your data handling logic, you'll use reducer composition and create multiple reducers that can be combined together, instead of creating separate stores. The Redux core library has a <span style="color: Yellow;">createStore</span> API that will create the store. It accepts following parameters:

1. <span style="color: Cyan;">reducer</span> (`Required`): The reducer function defines how the state changes in response to actions.
2. <span style="color: Cyan;">preloadedState</span> (`Optional`, Type: `Object`, Default: `undefined`): It is an object which should match the shape expected by the reducer. It is used for:
   - Server-side rendering (SSR): Hydrate the client-side state with server-rendered data.
   - Restoring state from local storage or a session.
3. <span style="color: Cyan;">enhancer</span> (`Optional`, Type: `Function`, Default: `undefined`): A store enhancer is like a special version of `createStore` that adds another layer wrapping around the original Redux store. An enhanced store can then change how the store behaves, by supplying its own versions of the store's `dispatch`, `getState`, and `subscribe` functions instead of the originals. <span style="color: Gold;">If you don't have any `preloadedState` to pass in, you can pass the `enhancer` as the second argument instead.</span> It is typically used to:
   - Add middleware for handling asynchronous actions or logging.
   - Integrate with development tools like Redux DevTools.

<div style="border: 1px solid yellow; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(242, 145, 145, 0.2);">

❌ <b style="color:Orange;">The original Redux core `createStore` method is deprecated!</b> ❌

This deprecation is solely a visual indicator that is meant to encourage users to migrate their apps from legacy Redux patterns to use the modern Redux Toolkit APIs. Switch to using `legacy_createStore` and nothing else changes!

</div>

<br>

```js
// import { createStore } from 'redux' ❌

import { legacy_createStore as createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

`store` API methods:

- <span style="color: springgreen;">getState()</span>: Returns the current state of the application. The Redux store doesn't make an extra copy of the `state` value when you call `getState()`. It's exactly the same reference that was returned from the root reducer function. Hence, one must on mutate it.
- <span style="color: springgreen;">dispatch(`action`)</span>: Dispatches an action to the reducer to update the state.
- <span style="color: springgreen;">subscribe(`listener`)</span>: Registers a callback to be invoked on state changes and returns an `unsubscribe` function to stop listening to state changes.
- <span style="color: springgreen;">replaceReducer(`nextReducer`)</span>: Replaces the current reducer with a new one.

```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_USER', payload: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' } });

const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('State has changed:', store.getState());
});

unsubscribe(); // Stops the listener from being called
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">4. Adding middleware (Optional)</h3>

Enhancers are powerful because they can override or replace any of the store's methods: `dispatch`, `getState`, and `subscribe`. But, much of the time, we only need to customize how `dispatch` behaves. It would be nice if there was a way to add some customized behavior when `dispatch` runs.

Redux uses a special kind of addon called `middleware` to let us customize the dispatch function. **Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.** People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

Redux middleware are actually implemented on top of a very special store enhancer that comes built in with Redux, called <span style="color: Lime;">applyMiddleware</span>. Middleware is applied using the this function only, which is passed to the `createStore` function as an enhancer.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducer';
import { print1, print2, print3 } from './exampleAddons/middleware';

const middlewareEnhancer = applyMiddleware(print1, print2, print3);

// Pass enhancer as the second arg, since there's no preloadedState
const store = createStore(rootReducer, middlewareEnhancer);

export default store;
```

Middleware form a pipeline around the store's `dispatch` method. When we call `store.dispatch(action)`, we're actually calling the first middleware in the pipeline. That middleware can then do anything it wants when it sees the action. Typically, a middleware will check to see if the action is a specific type that it cares about, much like a reducer would. If it's the right type, the middleware might run some custom logic. Otherwise, it passes the action to the next middleware in the pipeline. <span style="color: Magenta;">Unlike a reducer, middleware can have side effects inside, including timeouts and other async logic</span>. In this case, the action is passed through:

1. The `print1` middleware (which we see as `store.dispatch`)
2. The `print2` middleware
3. The `print3` middleware
4. The original `store.dispatch`
5. The root reducer inside store

And since these are all function calls, they all return from that call stack. So, the `print1` middleware is the first to run, and the last to finish.

We can also write our own middleware. You might not need to do this all the time, but custom middleware are a great way to add specific behaviors to a Redux application. Redux middleware are written as a series of three nested functions. Let's see what that pattern looks like.

```js
// Middleware written as ES5 functions

// Outer function:
function exampleMiddleware(storeAPI) {
  return function wrapDispatch(next) {
    return function handleAction(action) {
      // Do anything here: pass the action onwards with next(action),
      // or restart the pipeline with storeAPI.dispatch(action)
      // Can also use storeAPI.getState() here

      return next(action);
    };
  };
}
```

Let's break down what these three functions do and what their arguments are:

- `exampleMiddleware`: The outer function is actually the "middleware" itself. It will be called by `applyMiddleware`, and receives a `storeAPI` object containing the store's `{dispatch, getState}` functions. These are the same `dispatch` and `getState` functions that are actually part of the store. If you call this `dispatch` function, it will send the action to the start of the middleware pipeline. This is only called once.
- `wrapDispatch`: The middle function receives a function called `next` as its argument. This function is actually the next middleware in the pipeline. If this middleware is the last one in the sequence, then `next` is actually the original `store.dispatch` function instead. Calling `next(action)` passes the action to the next middleware in the pipeline. This is also only called once
- `handleAction`: Finally, the inner function receives the current `action` as its argument, and will be called every time an action is dispatched.

We can use arrow functions as well:

```js
const anotherExampleMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  // Do something in here, when each action is dispatched

  return next(action);
};
```

Example of some custom middleware - logging state, delaying dispatching of action, async calls:

```js
import { client } from '../../api/client';

const loggerMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log('dispatching', action);
  let result = next(action);
  console.log('next state', storeAPI.getState());
  return result;
};

const delayedActionMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/todoAdded') {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Delay this action by one second
      next(action);
    }, 1000);
    return;
  }

  return next(action);
};

const fetchTodosMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/fetchTodos') {
    // Make an API call to fetch todos from the server
    client.get('todos').then((todos) => {
      storeAPI.dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos }); // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
    });
  }

  return next(action);
};
```

Since middleware form a pipeline around the real `store.dispatch` function, this also means that we could actually pass something that isn't a plain action object to `dispatch`, as long as a middleware intercepts that value and doesn't let it reach the reducers. Middleware also have access to `dispatch` and `getState`. That means you could write some async logic in a middleware, and still have the ability to interact with the Redux store by dispatching actions.

Both of the last 2 middlewares in previous example were very specific and only do one thing. It would be nice if we had a way to write any async logic ahead of time, separate from the middleware itself, and still have access to `dispatch` and `getState` so that we can interact with the store.

**What if we wrote a middleware that let us pass a function to dispatch, instead of an action object?** We could have our middleware check to see if the "action" is actually a function instead, and if it's a function, call the function right away. That would let us write async logic in separate functions, outside of the middleware definition.

```js
const asyncFunctionMiddleware = (storeAPI) => (next) => (action) => {
  // If the "action" is actually a function instead...
  if (typeof action === 'function') return action(storeAPI.dispatch, storeAPI.getState); // then call the function with `dispatch` and `getState`

  return next(action); // Otherwise, it's a normal action - send it onwards
};
```

And then we could use that middleware like this:

```js
const middlewareEnhancer = applyMiddleware(asyncFunctionMiddleware);
const store = createStore(rootReducer, middlewareEnhancer);

// Write a function that has `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
const fetchSomeData = (dispatch, getState) => {
  // Make an async HTTP request
  client.get('todos').then((todos) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos }); // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
    const allTodos = getState().todos; // Check the updated store state after dispatching
    console.log('Number of todos after loading: ', allTodos.length);
  });
};

// Pass the _function_ we wrote to `dispatch`
store.dispatch(fetchSomeData);
// logs: 'Number of todos after loading: ###'
```

Again, notice that this "async function middleware" let us pass a function to `dispatch`! Inside that function, we were able to write some async logic (an HTTP request), then dispatch a normal action object when the request completed.

As it turns out, Redux already has an official version of that "async function middleware", called the <b style="color:Coral;">Redux "Thunk" middleware</b>. The thunk middleware allows us to write functions that get `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments. The thunk functions can have any async logic we want inside, and that logic can dispatch actions and read the store state as needed. **Writing async logic as thunk functions allows us to reuse that logic without knowing what Redux store we're using ahead of time.** The Redux thunk middleware is available on NPM as a package called <span style="color: Chartreuse;">redux-thunk</span>. We need to install that package to use it in our app:

```bash
npm install redux-thunk
```

Once it's installed, we can update the Redux store in our todo app to use that middleware:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
import rootReducer from './reducer';

const composedEnhancer = composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware));

// The store now has the ability to accept thunk functions in `dispatch`
const store = createStore(rootReducer, composedEnhancer);
export default store;
```

We'll start by writing a thunk function that makes an HTTP call to our `/fakeApi/todos` endpoint to request an array of todo objects, and then dispatch an action containing that array as the payload.

```js
import { client } from '../../../../api/client';

const initialState = [];

export default function todosReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // omit reducer logic
}

// Thunk function
export async function fetchTodos(dispatch, getState) {
  const response = await client.get('/fakeApi/todos');
  dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: response.todos });
}
```

# Standard Redux Patters

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">1. Mutative State Update</h3>

In Redux, immutability is critical because it ensures the state is predictable and enables features like time-travel debugging. However, writing immutable update logic by hand, especially nested states, can be verbose and error-prone.

<span style="color: Gold;">Immer</span> addresses this by allowing you to write "mutative" code while maintaining immutability under the hood.

Working:

- `Immer` produces immutable updates by creating a draft copy of the state.
- You can mutate this draft as if it were the actual state.
- After all mutations are done, `Immer` generates a new immutable state based on the draft.

```js
import produce from 'immer';

const initialState = { todos: [] };

// Using Immer to produce a new immutable state
const nextState = produce(initialState, (draft) => {
    draft.todos.push({ id: 1, text: 'Learn Immer', completed: false });
});

console.log(nextState);
// Output: { todos: [ { id: 1, text: 'Learn Immer', completed: false } ] }
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">2. Using Action Creators</h3>

In our app, we've been writing action objects directly in the code, where they're being dispatched:

```js
dispatch({ type: 'todos/todoAdded', payload: trimmedText });
```

However, in practice, well-written Redux apps don't actually write those action objects inline when we dispatch them. Instead, we use "action creator" functions. An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:

```js
const todoAdded = (text) => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: text,
  };
};
```

We can use a utility function <span style="color: Gold;">createAction</span> from <span style="color: Cyan;">redux-actions</span> library to simplify the process of creating action creators in Redux. It abstracts away the repetitive task of defining action creators manually, ensuring consistent and structured action objects.

```js
const setCounter = createAction('SET_COUNTER');

console.log(setCounter(5));
// Output: { type: 'SET_COUNTER', payload: 5 }
```

We can also use action creators with thunk functions also.

```js
export const fetchTodos = () => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const response = await client.get('/fakeApi/todos');
  dispatch(todosLoaded(response.todos));
};
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">3. Memoized Selectors</h3>

We've already seen that we can write "selector" functions, which accept the Redux `state` object as an argument, and return a value:

```js
const selectTodos = (state) => state.todos;
```

What if we need to derive some data? For example, maybe we want to have an array of only the todo IDs:

```js
const selectTodoIds = (state) => state.todos.map((todo) => todo.id);
```

<span style="color: Yellow;">createSelector</span> is a utility function provided by the <span style="color: Violet;">reselect</span> library, commonly used in Redux applications to create memoized selectors. Memoized selector functions are selectors that save the most recent result value, and if you call them multiple times with the same inputs, will return the same result value. If you call them with different inputs than last time, they will recalculate a new result value, cache it, and return the new result.

Installation:

```bash
npm install reselect
```

`createSelector` accepts one or more "input selector" functions as arguments, plus an "output selector", and returns the new selector function. Every time you call the selector:

- All "input selectors" are called with all of the arguments
- If any of the input selector return values have changed, the "output selector" will re-run
- All of the input selector results become arguments to the output selector
- The final result of the output selector is cached for next time

```js
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const selector = createSelector(
    [inputSelector1, inputSelector2, ...],
    (input1, input2, ...) => {
        // Derived data computation
        return derivedValue;
    }
);
```

Example:

```js
const selectTodos = (state) => state.todos;
const selectFilter = (state) => state.filter;

const selectVisibleTodos = createSelector([selectTodos, selectFilter], (todos, filter) => {
  switch (filter) {
    case 'completed':
      return todos.filter((todo) => todo.completed);
    case 'active':
      return todos.filter((todo) => !todo.completed);
    default:
      return todos;
  }
});

const state = {
  todos: [
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux', completed: true },
    { id: 2, text: 'Practice coding', completed: false },
  ],
  filter: 'completed',
};

console.log(selectVisibleTodos(state));
// Output: [{ id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux', completed: true }]
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">4. Simplify Reducers Creation</h3>

<span style="color: HotPink;">handleActions</span> is a utility function, commonly provided by the <span style="color: Cyan;">redux-actions</span> library, that simplifies the creation of reducers in Redux. It allows you to define multiple action handlers for a reducer in a cleaner and more organized way compared to using a switch statement.

The `handleActions` function takes two arguments:

1. **Action Handlers:** An object where each key is an action type, and the value is a reducer function that handles that action.
2. **Initial State:** The initial state of the reducer.

```js
import { handleActions } from 'redux-actions';

const reducer = handleActions(
  {
    ACTION_TYPE: (state, action) => {
      // Return the updated state
    },
  },
  initialState
);
```

<u>**EXAMPLE USAGE**</u>

Traditional Reducer with `switch`:

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Using `handleActions`:

```js
import { handleActions } from 'redux-actions';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = handleActions(
  {
    INCREMENT: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
    DECREMENT: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count - 1 }),
  },
  initialState
);

export default reducer;
```

</div>
