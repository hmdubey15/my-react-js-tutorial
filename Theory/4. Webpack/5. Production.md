# Caching

HTTP caching is a mechanism to store copies of HTTP responses at intermediate locations (like a browser, proxy server, or CDN) to reduce server load, improve performance, and decrease latency (response delay). It allows clients to reuse previously fetched resources without repeatedly contacting the server. It is particularly effective for static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files, but can also be applied to dynamic content with careful configuration.

<b style="color:red;">ðŸš¨ NOTE: ðŸš¨</b> Make sure <span style="color: Coral;">Disable cache</span> box is unchecked in network section, or else caching will be disabled.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Cacheable and Non-Cacheable Responses</h3>

Not all responses can be cached. HTTP defines specific rules to determine cacheability:

1. <span style="color: Violet;">Cacheable:</span> Most `GET` requests, unless explicitly marked otherwise.
2. <span style="color: Violet;">Non-cacheable:</span> `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, or responses with headers like `Cache-Control: no-store`.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Cache Locations</h3>

1. <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Browser Cache:</span> Stores responses locally on the user's device.
2. <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Proxy Cache:</span> Shared among multiple users, typically managed by an organization or ISP.
3. <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue;">Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</span> Distribute cached resources across servers globally.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">HTTP Headers for caching</h3>

1. <span style="color: Lime;">Cache-Control</span>: A directive that specifies caching policies. Common values include:

   - <span style="color: Gold;">max-age=N</span>: Indicates the resource is fresh for `N` seconds.
   - <span style="color: Gold;">no-cache</span>: The cache must validate with the server before using the cached resource.
   - <span style="color: Gold;">no-store</span>: Prevents storing the response in any cache.
   - <span style="color: Gold;">private</span>: The response is specific to a single user and shouldn't be cached by shared caches.
   - <span style="color: Gold;">public</span>: The response can be cached by any cache.
2. <span style="color: Lime;">ETag</span>: An ETag (entity tag) is a unique identifier (a hash or checksum) representing a specific version of a resource. Example: `ETag: "12345abcde"`. Working:
    - When a server sends a resource, it also sends an ETag in the `ETag` header.
    - The browser stores this ETag. Â  
    - On subsequent requests, the browser sends the stored ETag in the `If-None-Match` header.
    - The server recalculates the ETag for the current version of the resource.
    - If the recalculated ETag matches the ETag in the `If-None-Match header`, the resource hasn't changed, and the server sends a `304` response.
3. <span style="color: Lime;">If-None-Match</span>: As described above, it is request header included by the client to indicate that the server is only to complete the HTTP request if none of the specified HTTP ETag headers match. Otherwise, the server will return the HTTP `304 Not Modified` status code.
4. <span style="color: Lime;">Last-Modified</span>: 
    - The server sends this header, indicating the date and time when the resource was last modified.
    - The browser stores this timestamp.
    - On subsequent requests, the browser sends the stored timestamp in the `If-Modified-Since` header.
    - The server compares the timestamp in the `If-Modified-Since` header with the resource's current modification time.
    - If the resource hasn't been modified since that timestamp, the server sends a `304` response. Â  
    - Comparing timestamps is also a very fast operation.
5. <span style="color: Lime;">If-Modified-Since</span>: The client sends this header to ask if the resource has changed since the given date.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Caching Mechanism</h3>

<b style="color:Orange;">Freshness:</b> If a cached response is still "fresh" (based on `Cache-Control` or `Expires`: For example, with `max-age=604800`, a response is fresh for one week), it's served directly from the cache without contacting the server again. When age exceeds `max-age`, the response is "stale" and requires validation unless otherwise specified.

<b style="color:Orange;">Validation:</b> If a cached response is stale, the cache can perform a validation request to check if the resource has been modified. The cache sends a `GET` request with headers like <span style="color: Cyan;">If-Modified-Since</span> or <span style="color: Cyan;">If-None-Match</span> and server checks if resource is modified using <span style="color: Cyan;">ETag</span> or <span style="color: Cyan;">Last-Modified</span>. If the resource hasn't changed, the server responds with a <span style="color: Coral;">304 Not Modified</span>, and the cache uses the existing response. If changed, a new response is sent with the updated content.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Cache Invalidation</h3>

Cache invalidation ensures the cached content reflects the latest updates. Methods include:

- <span style="color: HotPink;">Explicit Invalidation:</span> Sending `Cache-Control: no-cache` or similar headers.
- <span style="color: HotPink;">Automatic Expiration:</span> Using `max-age` or `Expires`.
- <span style="color: HotPink;">Manual Purging:</span> Clearing caches at CDNs or browsers via APIs or configuration.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Deleting stored responses</h3>

There is basically no way to delete responses that have already been stored with a long `max-age`. You may want to overwrite that response once it expired on the server, but there is nothing the server can do once the response is stored â€” since no more requests reach the server due to caching. One of the methods mentioned in the specification is to send a request for the same URL with an unsafe method such as `POST`, but that is usually difficult to intentionally do for many clients. Therefore, it should be assumed that any stored response will remain for its `max-age` period unless the user manually performs a `reload`, `force-reload`, or clear-history action.

Caching reduces access to the server, which means that the server loses control of that URL. If the server does not want to lose control of a URL â€” for example, in the case that a resource is frequently updated â€” you should add `no-cache` so that the server will always receive requests and send the intended responses.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Cache Busting</h3>

<span style="color: HotPink;">Cache-busting</span> is a technique used to ensure that clients (like browsers) receive the latest version of a resource, even if it is cached (<span style="color:red;">cache is not expired</span>). It is a strategy for solving problems related to stale resources being served from a cache. When a browser caches static files such as JavaScript, CSS, or images, these files may not be updated immediately if their names remain the same. Cache busting involves changing the resource's URL whenever the content changes, ensuring the browser fetches the updated file instead of serving a stale cached version. 

This is typically done by appending a unique identifier (such as a hash) to the filenames of assets. When the content of the file changes, the hash changes, resulting in a new filename.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  output: {
    filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    clean: true,
  },
};
```

Here are the best practices for cache busting:

- <span style="color: Gold;">Combine with Long Expiry Headers:</span> Set <span style="color: Salmon;">Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable</span>:
    - `max-age=31536000`: To store the cache for long time
    - `immutable`: To prevent validation on reload.
    - `public`: Makes the response storable even if the `Authorization` header is present.
- <span style="color: Gold;">Use Automated Tools:</span> Automate file hashing or versioning during the build process.
- <span style="color: Gold;">Avoid Query Strings:</span> Use file name versioning for better compatibility with CDNs and proxies.
- <span style="color: Gold;">Invalidate Only When Necessary:</span> Update the cache only when content changes to maximize efficiency.

# Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique used to split your JavaScript bundle into various chunks which can be loaded on demand or in parallel. Following are reasons to use this technique:

<b style="color:LightGreen;">1. Improved Load Times:</b> By splitting code into smaller chunks, you can load only the necessary code for a specific page or feature.

<b style="color:LightGreen;">2. Efficient Caching:</b> Changes in a specific chunk won't invalidate the cache for other chunks, reducing the need to re-download unchanged code.

<b style="color:LightGreen;">3. Parallel Loading:</b> Allows for simultaneous loading of chunks, speeding up overall page load.

<b style="color:LightGreen;">4. Lazy Loading:</b> Code splitting enables lazy loading, where code is fetched dynamically when it's needed.

<b style="color:LightGreen;">5. Bundle Size Optimization:</b> Large bundles can slow down application performance. Splitting reduces the size of individual bundles.

There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

1. <span style="color: Coral;">Entry Points:</span> Manually split code using <span style="color: Cyan;">entry</span> configuration.
2. <span style="color: Coral;">Prevent Duplication:</span> Use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#dependencies">Entry dependencies</a> or <span style="color: Violet;">SplitChunksPlugin</span> to dedupe and split chunks.
3. <span style="color: Coral;">Dynamic Imports / Lazy Loading:</span> Split code via inline function calls within modules.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;"><a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/">SplitChunksPlugin</a></h3>

Originally, chunks (and modules imported inside them) were connected by a parent-child relationship in the internal webpack graph. The <span style="color: Orange;">CommonsChunkPlugin</span> was used to avoid duplicated dependencies across them, but further optimizations were not possible. Since webpack v4, the `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed in favor of <span style="color: Lime;">optimization.splitChunks</span>. The <span style="color: HotPink;">SplitChunksPlugin</span> uses rules defined in the `optimization.splitChunks` configuration to decide:

- Which modules to split.
- How to group the chunks.
- How to name the output chunks.

By default it only affects on-demand chunks, because changing initial chunks would affect the script tags the HTML file should include to run the project. Webpack will automatically split chunks based on these conditions:

- New chunk can be shared OR modules are from the `node_modules` folder
- New chunk would be bigger than 20kb (before min+gz)
- Maximum number of parallel requests when loading chunks on demand would be lower or equal to 30
- Maximum number of parallel requests at initial page load would be lower or equal to 30

By separating frequently changing application code from stable vendor libraries (like React or Lodash), it improves caching efficiency. Browsers can cache vendor chunks for longer periods, reducing the need to download them on subsequent visits. 

Webpack 5 comes with `SplitChunksPlugin` enabled by default in production mode, but you can fine-tune its behavior through configuration. The default configuration was chosen to fit web performance best practices, but the optimal strategy for your project might differ. If you're changing the configuration, you should measure the effect of your changes to ensure there's a real benefit. Here are some configurations of `optimization.splitChunks`:

- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">chunks</span><span style="color: Coral;">(string: 'all', 'initial', 'async')</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 'all']</span>: Determines which chunks will be selected for optimization.
  - `'all'`: Split both synchronous and asynchronous chunks.
  - `'async'`: Split only asynchronous chunks (default).
  - `'initial'`: Split only synchronous chunks.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">minSize</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 20000]</span>: The minimum size, in bytes, for a chunk to be generated. Prevents the creation of very small chunks.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">maxSize</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 0]</span>: The maximum size, in bytes, for a chunk. If a chunk exceeds this size, it will be split into smaller chunks.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">minChunks</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 1]</span>: The minimum number of times a module must be shared among chunks before it is split into a separate chunk. Ensures that modules used infrequently do not get split unnecessarily.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">maxAsyncRequests</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 30]</span>: Max allowed parallel requests at entry point for asynchronous chunks. Limits the number of concurrent requests for better performance.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">maxInitialRequests</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 30]</span>: The maximum number of parallel requests to load initial chunks. Limits the number of initial loading requests.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">enforceSizeThreshold</span><span style="color: Coral;">(number)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: 50000]</span>: Size threshold at which splitting is enforced and other restrictions (minRemainingSize, maxAsyncRequests, maxInitialRequests) are ignored.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">name</span><span style="color: Coral;">(boolean | string | function)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: true]</span>: The name of the split chunk. Providing `false` will keep the same name of the chunks so it doesn't change names unnecessarily. It is the recommended value for production builds.
- <span style="color: SpringGreen;">cacheGroups</span><span style="color: Coral;">(boolean | string | function)</span><span style="color: Violet;">[Default: true]</span>: Allows for more granular control over how code is split into chunks. It lets us define custom groups of modules that should be bundled together based on specific criteria. This is particularly useful for managing vendor libraries, common code, and other shared modules. This option is an object where each key defines a new cache group with its own set of rules for chunk splitting.
  - <span style="color: Cyan;">test</span><span style="color: Magenta;">(regex | string | function)</span>: Determines which modules should be included in the group.
  - <span style="color: Cyan;">name</span><span style="color: Magenta;">(string | function)</span>: Specifies the name of the resulting chunk.
  - <span style="color: Cyan;">priority</span><span style="color: Magenta;">(integer)</span>: Defines the priority of the cache group. Higher priority groups are processed first.
  - <span style="color: Cyan;">reuseExistingChunk</span><span style="color: Magenta;">(boolean)</span>: Reuses existing chunks instead of creating new ones if possible.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Lazy Loading / Dynamic Imports</h3>

This technique refers to <span style="color: OrangeRed;">on-demand code loading</span>â€”loading JavaScript modules only when they are required during runtime rather than bundling them with the main application code. This technique helps optimize the application's performance by reducing the initial load time and improving perceived performance.

This is implemented in JavaScript using the <span style="color: Khaki;">import()</span> function. This function allows modules to be loaded asynchronously. Unlike `import` statements that load modules statically at compile time, `import()` defers the loading of modules until they are needed.

```js
import('./module.js')
  .then((module) => {
    // Use the dynamically loaded module
    module.default();
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error loading the module:', err);
  });
```

Webpack treats `import()` as a signal to create a split point in the code:

- Splits the module (`module.js`) into a separate chunk.
- Generates a separate JavaScript file for this chunk (e.g., `module.js` becomes `1.js` or a named chunk).
- Loads the chunk dynamically when the `import()` function is called.

<b><u>Magic Comments</u></b>

By adding comments to the import, we can do things such as name our chunk or select different modes. They are are special **Webpack directives**. They allow developers to provide additional information or hints to Webpack during the code-splitting process. These are not standard JavaScript commentsâ€”they are specifically recognized and used by Webpack when processing dynamic imports. Important examples:

```js
import(/* webpackChunkName: "feature" */ './feature.js');
import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './feature.js');
import(/* webpackPreload: true */ './feature.js');
```

- `webpackChunkName`: Sets a custom name for the dynamically imported chunk. Makes debugging easier by assigning descriptive names to dynamically imported chunks.
- `webpackPrefetch`: A prefetched chunk starts after the parent chunk finishes loading. A prefetched chunk is downloaded while the browser is idle.
- `webpackPreload`: A preloaded chunk starts loading in parallel to the parent chunk. Preloaded chunks are fetched with higher priority than prefetch chunks. A preloaded chunk has medium priority and is instantly downloaded.

# Creating production server with express framework

For running our application in production mode, it is generally not advisable to use `webpack-dev-server` for following reasons:

- It is designed for development use. It provides features like hot module replacement (HMR), live reloading, and detailed debugging information, which are not optimized for performance.
- It lacks many of the security features and configurations that are standard in production servers. It might expose the application to various security vulnerabilities if used in a production environment.
- It does not support advanced server features like load balancing, request routing, and handling of SSL/TLS certificates, which are essential for production environments.

**INSTALLATION:**

```bash
npm install express
```

**CREATING THE SERVER:**

```js
// server/index.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files from the 'dist' directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

// Handle all other routes with the index.html file
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

- `express`: This imports the Express module, which is a web application framework for Node.js.
- `app`: This contains an instance of Expres application.
- `app.use`: This is used to mount middleware functions.
- `express.static`: It is built-in middleware function in Express that serves static files from the `dist` directory.
- `app.get('*', (req, res) => {...})`: This sets up a route handler for all GET requests (`*` is a wildcard that matches all routes). This is useful for single-page applications (SPAs) where all routes should serve the same index.html file.
- `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'))`: This sends the `index.html` file from the `dist` directory as the response to any GET request. This ensures that the client-side routing can take over after the initial page load.
- `app.listen(PORT, () => {...})`: This starts the server and makes it listen for incoming requests on the specified port (`PORT`).

# Compression

**THESE COMPRESSIONS ARE NOT APPLIED AUTOMATICALLY. YOU HAVE TO APPLY IT MANUALLY.**

<b style="color:Khaki;">Gzip compression</b> is a widely-used method for reducing the size of files that are sent over the web, which can significantly improve load times and overall performance of web applications. When gzip compression is enabled in Webpack setup, it compresses JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and other text-based files before serving them to clients, leading to faster download times.

**WORKING:**

- **Compression:** Gzip compresses files by finding repetitive patterns within the files and replacing them with shorter representations. This can drastically reduce the file size.
- **Decompression:** Modern browsers can automatically decompress gzip files when they are received, making the process seamless for users.

To enable gzip compression in Webpack setup, we can use the <b style="color:Magenta;">compression-webpack-plugin</b>. This plugin will compress output files using gzip and create `.gz` versions of them.

**INSTALLATION:**

```bash
npm install compression-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

**UPDATE WEBPACK CONFIG:**

```js
const path = require('path');
const CompressionPlugin = require('compression-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new CompressionPlugin({
      filename: '[path][base].gz', // Define the output filename format
      algorithm: 'gzip', // Specify the compression algorithm
      test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/, // (OPTIONAL) Define which files to compress
      threshold: 10240, // (OPTIONAL) Only compress files larger than this threshold (in bytes)
      minRatio: 0.8, // (OPTIONAL) Only compress files if the compression ratio is better than this
    }),
  ],
};
```

- <span style="color: Lime;">filename</span>: Specifies the naming convention for the compressed files. [path][base].gz will generate files like bundle.js.gz.
- <span style="color: Lime;">algorithm</span>: Sets the compression algorithm to use. In this case, it's gzip.
- <span style="color: Lime;">test</span>: Defines which files should be compressed using a regular expression. This example compresses JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and SVG files.
- <span style="color: Lime;">threshold</span>: Sets the minimum file size in bytes before compression is applied. Files smaller than this size will not be compressed.
- <span style="color: Lime;">minRatio</span>: Sets the minimum compression ratio that must be achieved for compression to be applied. Files that do not meet this ratio will not be compressed.

After this we will be able to see compressed versions of bundles available in `dist` folder along with original bundles. Now we need to configure our web server to serve the `.gz` files when a client supports gzip encoding. There is a special middleware for Express framework that allows us to do this - <b style="color:Violet;">compression</b>

**INSTALLATION:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev compression
```

**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**

```js
// ....
const compression = require('compression');
// .....
app.use(compression());
```

<b style="color:Gold;">Brotli compression</b> Brotli compression is a modern, general-purpose, lossless compression algorithm developed by Google. It provides better compression ratios than older algorithms like gzip, which means it can reduce file sizes even more effectively. Brotli is particularly effective for text-based files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for web applications.

Brotli works by using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and second-order context modeling. These techniques allow Brotli to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining good decompression speed, which is crucial for web performance.

To enable Brotli compression in Webpack setup, we can use the same `compression-webpack-plugin` with Brotli support. This plugin will compress output files using Brotli and create `.br` versions of them.

**UPDATE WEBPACK CONFIG:**

```js
const path = require('path');
const CompressionPlugin = require('compression-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new CompressionPlugin({
      filename: '[path][base].br',
      algorithm: 'brotliCompress',
      test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/,
      compressionOptions: { level: 11 }, // Brotli compression level (0-11)
      threshold: 10240,
      minRatio: 0.8,
    }),
  ],
};
```

**CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (which are different from gzip one)**:

- <span style="color: HotPink;">compressionOptions</span>: Additional options for Brotli compression. The `level` option specifies the compression level, with `11` being the maximum. It signigies effort that the algorithm should use when compressing files. This setting controls the balance between compression time and the compression ratio (i.e., how small the compressed files will be).

**SERVER CONFIGURATION**

The compression middleware in Express automatically compresses responses on-the-fly using gzip (or Brotli if configured). However, there's another middleware that serves pre-compressed files (like `.gz` or `.br`) directly from the file system - <b style="color:Crimson;">express-static-gzip</b>. Install it like others in dev dependency.

```js
// ....

const expressStaticGzip = require('express-static-gzip');
// .....

// Serve Brotli-compressed files
app.use(
  '/',
  expressStaticGzip(path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), {
    // express.static replaced by expressStaticGzip
    enableBrotli: true,
    orderPreference: ['br', 'gz'],
  })
);

// .....
```

<span style="color: Cyan;">This middleware serves the Brotli-compressed files if the client supports it, falling back to gzip or uncompressed files otherwise.</span>

# <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">Tree Shaking</a>

Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly with module bundlers like Webpack, to describe the process of eliminating dead code (code that is never used or executed) from the final bundle. This optimization technique helps reduce the size of the output JavaScript file, leading to faster load times and improved performance.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Conditions to enable tree shaking</h3>

<b style="color:Orange;">1. ES6 Modules:</b> Tree shaking relies on the static nature of ES6 module imports and exports. Unlike CommonJS, ES6 modules can be statically analyzed at build time, enabling Webpack to determine which parts of the code are actually used. Make sure third-party libraries being used support tree shaking. Libraries should provide ES6 module builds and correctly specify side effects. For example: `lodash` doesn't use ES6 import-export so we can use it's alternative `lodash-es`.

<b style="color:Orange;">2. Production Mode:</b> Webpack performs tree shaking automatically in production mode by enabling optimizations like minification and dead code elimination.

<b style="color:Orange;">3. Side Effects:</b> The <span style="color: Lime;">sideEffects</span> property in `package.json` tells Webpack whether a module or file has side effects (code that changes global state, performing I/O operations or performs actions when imported).

Importing the below module will cause the console log to be executed immediately, regardless of whether `greet` is used or not.

```js
// side-effects.js
console.log('This module has side effects');

export function greet() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

**Default Behavior:** Webpack assumes all modules have side effects unless specified.

**Recommended Configuration:** Declare in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

This tells Webpack that all files in your project are "pure" (i.e., have no side effects). If some files do have side effects, explicitly list them:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": ["*.css", "*.scss"]
}
```

</div>
